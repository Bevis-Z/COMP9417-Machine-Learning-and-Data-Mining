In our project, we implemented the recommender system based the dataset provided by Otto and Kaggle, and basically we have tried the following method: 


For the Co-visitation Matrix method, there are two files in total:
1. co-visitation-matrix-model.ipynb
https://www.kaggle.com/gambitwister/co-visitation-matrix-model

2. co-visitation-matrix-pred.ipynb
https://www.kaggle.com/code/gambitwister/co-visitation-matrix-pred

For the Word2vec model, one file in total:
1.w2vec.ipynb
https://www.kaggle.com/code/simonxm/comp9417-project



Please run these notebooks in Kaggle environment, as the dataset can be loaded easily.
Or in other words, please click the links and start to run the notebooks.

The final outcome file submission_covisitaion.csv, submission_w2vec.csv is too large to saved in the zip file, but you can check it through the following link on the Kaggle:
